This is my repository for DATA130051.01 2022 spring.

### Assignment 1

This assignment is a simple warm up for neural network. We are required to construct a two layer neural network to classify the MNIST hand writing number data set.

To train the network, please download the entire directory of *Assignment1* and follow the guidance of notebook *Training.ipynb*. I've already downloaded the MNIST dataset and preprocess them in *mnist.pkl*, you don't need to download it again.

All the code in this assignment could run successfully using python 3.8.12.
